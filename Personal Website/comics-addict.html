            <p>I've always been a huge movies and literature fan. I've seen and read countless movies and books of each and every genre. From action to thriller to horror to romance, all of it.</p>
            <p>Of course like most kids, my fascination for these things came from cartoons. Cartoon Network, Pogo etc of course heavily influenced my tastes.</p>
            <p>Though if I had to say what really kickstarted my particular fascination for comic books, it was my 6th birthday. One of the gifts I received was a CD with the entire Spider-man trilogy on it.</p>
            <p>From there started my love for what I can confidently say is objectively the best comic book character of all time, Spider-man. And yes, I am still a big fan till now.</p>
            <p>The Spider-man movies also made me gain interest for other superhero movies. And then of course as I grew up came the emergence of the Marvel Cinenamtic Universe, which put comic book superheroes in the limelight. It was a tremendous success and really invigorated an even deeper love for superheroes into the general public than what was already present.</p>
            <p>And me being the massive comics nerd I am, I went online and started reading comic books. I read the entire line of Spider-man comics from The Amazing Fantasy #15 (debut comic) to The Amazing Spider-man ongoing series including the spin-off comics. To put this into perespective, I read nearly 5000 issues of Spider-man comics. Yeah, I love Spider-man, don't question it.</p>
            <p>I started reading other superhero comic books too. I even read other brands like DC, Image etc.</p>
            <p>It might seem kiddish what I'm saying, but comics genuinely contain some of the best pieces of fiction I have ever read. A combination of detailed stories and intricate artstyle along with the years of character history make it truly an enigmatic experience to read.</p>
            <p>The characters of a particular existing in a shared universe also lead to a lot of entertaining interactions and crossover comics which are hype-worthy and fun.</p>
